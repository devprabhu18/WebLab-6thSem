# Web Programming laboratory Programs-6th Sem

I have added all the programs in a simplest way possible. (S.I.: Some of them may lack CSS, I will add it soon)

### Additional Information:

All the programs are in separate folders according to the program number. Navigate through them correctly before running (especially for React programs)
S.I.: I have used the below command to create the React project  
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```


## Usage (For React Programs)

```python
# navigate to the folder
cd foldername

# install dependencies
npm install

# run the program
npm run dev
```
